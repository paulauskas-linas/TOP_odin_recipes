# Project: Recipes
Project based on The Odin Project resource.
The project idea was to create main index page as recipe book and 3 html pages for recipes. I added to the project a little bit more, made it more personal by adding my national dishes and adding some styling. 

Through this project learned and/or revised:

* html markup
* css styling, box model, layout
* basic git - add, commit, push, status, ignore
* basic cmd - cd, cp, rm
